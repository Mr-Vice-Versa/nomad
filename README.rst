 Nomad
=======

Nomad is a simple migration application, which specifically takes into account
properties of development with DVCS and is completely agnostic from ORM or
whatever you are using to access your database. It uses simple SQL scripts to
migrate and can run pre- and post-processing routines written in Python (or any
other language).
